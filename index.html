			<div class = "about" style = "background-image: url('Assets/me.jpg') ">
				<p> An enthusiastic, self-motivated final year student at the University of Lincoln studying Computer Science (BSc) with strong experience in C#, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript and the development of applications for desktop, mobile devices and web. Self-taught Python and Unity for the purposes of producing a final year thesis and completed a three month internship at Experian as a data management intern producing an Alteryx tool using Python. This would be an excellent opportunity to apply and improve on skills acquired throughout University in a positive working environment.  </p>

				<h1>Lincoln Cathedral AR</h1>
				<video height="80%"  controls>
				<source src="Assets/AR.mp4" type="video/mp4">
				</video>
				<p>This application was developed as my dissertation project for University. I created an augmented reality application for Lincoln Cathedral using
					Googles ARCore and Unity. Many sections were created through combining Unitys physics engine capabilities with ARCore elements to augment objects
				and allow the user to iteract with them.</p>

				<h1>My Food Tracker</h1>
				<video height="80%" controls>
				<source src="Assets/food tracker.mp4" type="video/mp4">
				</video>
				<p>I developed this app for a cross-platform development module at university. We used react-native combined with DOM elements to produce the application
				Each application needed to be related to one specific area in particular and mine was sustainability. I created an application that allowed the user to store information
			about items they had bought that would expire. The app uses various API's to access the device calendar, notification system and camera to allow users to store these items and
		send reminders that will let them know when their items expire.</p>

				<p>This website was created in my first semester of University. We were taught to use HTML, CSS and Javascript to produe a website
				that included a section for customisation using javascript. One of the main features of this website is the use of cookies and js to customise and
			save designs of guitars that the user can make.</p>
